# SOOS-DAST-Python

## DAST Analysis Tool
The affordable no limit web vulnerability scanner.

Use **SOOS DAST** to:

1. Scan web apps and APIs defined by **OpenAPI**, **SOAP**, or **GraphQL**
2. Containerized solution runs in your environment
3. Manage issues via single-pane web dashboard shared with [SOOS SCA](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/soos-sca-github-action)
4. Track tickets in Jira or GitHub Issues

## Requirements
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Have your application or website reachable on some URL.  

## How to Use
To execute the script you need to run this command from a terminal:
``` shell
docker run -it --rm soosio/dast [--configFile CONFIGFILE] [--clientId CLIENTID] [--apiKey APIKEY] [--projectName PROJECTNAME [PROJECTNAME ...]]

## Scan Modes

### Baseline

It runs the [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.

This means that the script doesn't perform any actual ‘attacks’ and will run for a relatively short period of time (a few minutes at most).

By default, it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change any rules to `FAIL` or `IGNORE`.

This mode is intended to be ideal to run in a `CI/CD` environment, even against production sites.

### Full Scan

It runs the [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.

This means that the script does perform actual ‘attacks’ and can potentially run for a long period of time.

By default, it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change any rules to FAIL or IGNORE. The configuration works in a very similar way as the [Baseline Mode](#baseline)

### API Scan

It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by `OpenAPI`, `SOAP`, or `GraphQL` via either a local file or a URL.

It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an `Active Scan` against the URLs found. The `Active Scan` is tuned to APIs, so it doesn't bother looking for things like `XSSs`.

It also includes 2 scripts that:
- Raise alerts for any HTTP Server Error response codes
- Raise alerts for any URLs that return content types that are not usually associated with APIs

### Active Scan

It attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the selected targets. `Active Scan` is an attack on those targets. You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.

`Active Scan` can only find certain types of vulnerabilities.

Logical vulnerabilities, such as broken access control, will not be found by any active or automated vulnerability scanning.

Manual penetration testing should always be performed in addition to active scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities.
